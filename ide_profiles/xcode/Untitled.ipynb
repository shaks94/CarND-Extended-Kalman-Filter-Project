    "### Where is Xcode IDE profile?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will generate one! Because IDE profiles can contain paths specific to your machine, we think the best way to get an Xcode IDE profile for this project is to generate one using `cmake`. Don't worry, it is really easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to generate Xcode IDE profile?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to install `cmake`. One way to do it is through downloading \"CMake\" app on the [cmake website](https://cmake.org/download/). Choose a version for \"Mac OSX\". After your download is complete, you can drag and drop \"CMake\" app to your \"Applications\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you would need to add `cmake` to a command line. To do so for the current session, execute the following command: `PATH=\"/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin\":\"$PATH\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to generate Xcode IDE profile, navigate to the directory of this README and execute the following command: `cmake -G \"Xcode\" ../..`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "After you have generated Xcode IDE profile using previous step, you should be able to find and open `ExtendedKF.xcodeproj` in the current directory. After that you can press ▶ button on the top left to build.\n",

    "### How to debug using Xcode IDE profile?\n",
    "\n",
    "First you would need to configure your profile for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the \"ALL_BUILD\" Scheme on the top left. Dropdown with Schemes will open.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scheme selection button](images/schemes_location.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select \"ExtendedKF\" in the dropdown.\n",

    "2. Open the dropdown again and select \"Edit Scheme...\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Edit scheme button](images/edit_scheme.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open \"Arguments\" tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Arguments tab](images/arguments_tab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add new item to the \"Arguments passed on launch\" section: `../../../data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt ../../../data/output.txt`. This would be the parameters that you pass to your program. You can edit it later on, to test for different set of inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Put a breakpoint in the section of the code that you expect to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Breakpoint](images/breakpoint.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Click ▶ on the top left. After these steps you should find your program stopped under debugger.\n",

    "### How to output contents of the Eigen object?\n",
    "\n",
    "While your program is stopped on a breakpoint, execute the following command in the \"Output\" window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(lldb) expr R_laser_.m_storage.m_data[0,0]\n",
    "(double) $23 = 0.022499999999999999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output contents of the `R_laser_` matrix at index `0, 0`.\n",
